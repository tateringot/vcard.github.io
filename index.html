        <h1>Matthew Rushing</h1>
        <h2>Graphic Designer</h2>
        <p>Hello, my name is Matthew Rushing. I was born in New Hampshire but have lived the majority of my life in Greenville, South Carolina. I am currently a student at <a href="https://www.bju.edu/">Bob Jones University</a> and I am going into my senior year of studying graphic design. Lord willing, I plan to graduate in May of 2021 and persue a career in graphic design.</p> <br>
        <p>I have a wide range of interests in the fields of art and graphic design. You can check out my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tateringot">Instagram</a> to see my photography and handlettering work. For my other work as well as an example of my web design, you can go to my <a href="https://portfolio-gallery-matthew-rushing.netlify.app/">online portfolio.</a>I am also interested in the fields of animation and illustration.</p> <br>
        <p>I have done graphic design work for a few actual clients. I designed a website for my mom called <a href="https://making-melody.netlify.app/">Making Melody</a> that allows people to play and download hymns she has written. I also designed the <a href="https://music.bju.edu/cosi/">poster</a> and various other applications including banners and backdrops for Bob Jones University's performance of <a href="https://today.bju.edu/news/bju-presents-mozarts-cosi-fan-tutte/">Cosi Fan Tutte.</a>
